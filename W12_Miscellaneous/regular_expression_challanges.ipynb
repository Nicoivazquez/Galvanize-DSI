    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python (or another language) and in Python they are made available through the [re module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html).  You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”. You can also use regex to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.  The official python docs [has a howto that is a great starting place](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#regex-howto).   \n",
