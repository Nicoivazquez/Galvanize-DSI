===========================

Simple example
=====================

Save the following file as `runtest.sh`

.. literalinclude:: runtest.sh
   :language: bash

The first two lines setup the envrionment as a bash envronment.  The `-j` specifies that standard out and standard err are put together in the out file.
The `-o` is the file path for the out file.  

Replace your email and change the two file paths to be real ones.  
Then in the same directory as `runtest.sh` save the following python script as `test.py`.

.. literalinclude:: test.py
   :language: python

:download:`test.py`

This is basically the standard hello world example.

Finally, submit the job to the queue using

.. code-block:: bash

   qsub runtest.sh

A more involved example
============================

This example uses python to generate and submit the bash scripts. 

.. literalinclude:: submitDistancesScripts.py
   :language: python

:download:`submitDistancesScripts.py`

.. literalinclude:: runDistances.py
   :language: python

:download:`runDistances.py`


Now you need to write a script to assemble all of the results into one file.
